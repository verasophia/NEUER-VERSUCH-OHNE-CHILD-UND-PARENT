smoking by about 10 percentage points compared to engaging in just one activity. Adolescents who engage in
music spend less time watching TV or playing computer games, but more reading books. The robustness of the

We analyze the determinants of successful high school graduation in Germany. As our main database, we use the youth file of GSOEP for the period extending from 2000 to 2007. Because the decision as to which secondary school track to attend - general school (Hauptschule), intermediate school (Realschule) or high school (Gymnasium) - is made after the end of elementary school (Grundschule) at age of ten, parents are responsible for this decision. Therefore, the characteristics of the child as well as those of its parents are the main determinants of educational attainment. We also include the characteristics of grandparents in our regression framework, something which has not been done in any previous study so far. In order to disentangle the determinants of successful graduation at high school, we use the Cox proportional hazard model. We find markedly different determinants of successful graduation for males and females. Furthermore, the results indicate a strong linkage between mothers and daughters, as well as between fathers and sons.},

(n  112,916; Grades 7–12) in British Columbia (Canada) to examine relationships between music
education (any participation, type of participation, music achievement, and engagement level) and
mathematics and science achievement in Grade 10 as well as English achievement in Grades 10 and 12,
while controlling for language/cultural background, Grade 7 academic achievement, and neighborhood
socioeconomic status. Music participation was related to higher scores on all 4 subjects and these
relationships were stronger for instrumental music than vocal music (Cohen’s d range: .28 to .44
[small-medium effect sizes] and .05 to .13 [null-small effect sizes]). School music achievement positively
related to scores on all subjects; such relationships were stronger for achievement in instrumental music
compared with vocal music. Higher levels of music engagement (number of courses) was related to
higher exam scores on all subjects; this pattern was more pronounced for very high engagement in
instrumental music (d range: .37 to .55; medium effect sizes) compared with vocal music (d range: .11
to .26; small effect sizes). The effect sizes of these group differences are greater than the effect sizes
corresponding to average annual gains of students’ academic achievement during high school—in other
words, highly engaged instrumental music students were, on average, academically over 1 year ahead of
their peers. The findings suggest that multiyear engagement in music, especially instrumental music, may
benefit high school academic achievement. Findings and implications are discussed within the broader
interdisciplinary literature on music learning.�},

decrease of overall average marks over 4 years from grades 3 to 6 was found in the control

school, but is obviously part of a multifactorial dependence. Continuous musical training
appears to help achieve and maintain school performance at a high level over time.�},

The authors focus is on documented associations regardless of the direction of causation between cognitive abilities, on the one hand, and music aptitude, music listening, and music lessons, on the other. In each case, the authors examine the possibility of a causal relationship between music and cognition.

  abstract  = {Although most studies that examined associations between music training and cognitive abilities had correlational designs, the prevailing bias is that music training causes improvements in cognition. It is also possible, however, that high-functioning children are more likely than other children to take music lessons, and that they also differ in personality. We asked whether individual differences in cognition and personality predict who takes music lessons and for how long. The participants were 118 adults (Study 1) and 167 10- to 12-year-old children (Study 2). We collected demographic information and measured cognitive ability and the Big Five personality dimensions. As in previous research, cognitive ability was associated with musical involvement even when demographic variables were controlled statistically. Novel findings indicated that personality was associated with musical involvement when demographics and cognitive ability were held constant, and that openness-to-experience was the personality dimension with the best predictive power. These findings reveal that: (1) individual differences influence who takes music lessons and for how long, (2) personality variables are at least as good as cognitive variables at predicting music training, and (3) future correlational studies of links between music training and non-musical ability should account for individual differences in personality.},

  abstract  = {Comparative public health research makes wide use of self-report instruments. For example, research identifying and explaining health disparities across demographic strata may seek to understand the health effects of patient attitudes or private behaviors. Such personal attributes are difficult or impossible to observe directly and are often best measured by self-reports. Defensible use of self-reports in quantitative comparative research requires not only that the measured constructs have the same meaning across groups, but also that group comparisons of sample estimates (eg, means and variances) reflect true group differences and are not contaminated by group-specific attributes that are unrelated to the construct of interest. Evidence for these desirable properties of measurement instruments can be established within the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) framework; a nested hierarchy of hypotheses is tested that addresses the cross-group invariance of the instrument's psychometric properties. By name, these hypotheses include configural, metric (or pattern), strong (or scalar), and strict factorial invariance. The CFA model and each of these hypotheses are described in nontechnical language. A worked example and technical appendices are included.},

Existing research related to child and youth PQOL is reviewed, followed by a discussion of the implications of the research for school psychology practice. Research with children and adolescents reveals that PQOL has a wide ranging network including personality, environmental, and activity variables. Furthermore, PQOL appears to mediate relationships between the environmental experiences of youth and problem behavior. Implications are discussed within the context of calls for greater attention by school psychologists to prevention, non-traditional assessment, direct service, consultation with teachers and parents, diversity issues, and the science-practice connection.

Such comparisons offer the prospect of understanding variations in levels of well-being and the factors contributing to it which can be useful for practical and policy initiatives to improve the lives of the population. However, relatively little is known about the extent to which such comparisons are reliable and valid, particularly in relation to children's well-being. We make use of a large-scale pilot survey undertaken in 11 countries with over 16,000 children around the age of 12 to explore this issue. We examine four different multi-item measures of children's subjective well-being, three of which have previously been proposed in the literature. We use multi-group confirmatory factor analysis to assess the extent to which it is valid to make cross-national comparisons using these measures. Overall, our results suggest that it should be possible to compare correlations and regressions between most of the countries in our survey using each of these measures. However, cross-national comparisons of mean scores on the measures is generally not supported by ou},

The child sample comprised 1,029 Victorian high-school students (aged 11–20) sampled across three independent studies. The adult sample comprised 1,965 Australian adults drawn from the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index. The results demonstrated strict factorial invariance between both versions, suggesting that the PWI measures the same underlying construct in adolescent and adult populations.

Another sample comprised 87 (59 undergraduate; 28 post-graduate) students who have never studied music. Females and males were represented in the samples. Age range of the participants was 18 – 25 years. They belonged to middle socio-economic status families as assessed by standardized tool [17]. They were residents of Kolkata. Tools administered for data collection included a General Information Schedule and three standardized tests viz. Psychological Well – Being Scales [14], Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale [11] and Socio – Economic Status Index [17]. Descriptive statistics were computed. Analysis of Variance was conducted. Results showed that stream of study (Music / Non-Music) had significant influence on participating tertiary students’ extents of autonomy, depression, anxiety and stress. Participating students of music tended to be superior in autonomy but on the average suffered more from depression, anxiety and stress as compared with their peers from other disciplines.
